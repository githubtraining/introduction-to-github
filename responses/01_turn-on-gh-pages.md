## Step 2: Turn on GitHub Pages

:tada: You're now the proud manager of this issue! Now that you've assigned yourself, people who drop by know that they're welcome to participate, but you'll be carrying this issue across the finish line. :sunglasses:.

### Let's use GitHub Pages

Now, on to business! GitHub Pages allow you to serve a static site from a repository. We've filled this repository with some site content, but the rendered site isn't visible right now. Let's change that.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Click on the [**Settings**]({{ repoUrl }}/settings) tab in this repository
1. In the sidebar, locate the "Code and automation" section and click on `Pages`
1. From the "Source" drop down, select **main branch**

> Note: Even though you'll see an option to choose a theme, do not apply a theme at this point. We've protected the code so you can't make unintended changes. You'll have the opportunity to apply a theme when the course is completed.

<h3 align="center">I'll respond in this issue when I detect GitHub Pages has deployed your site.</h3>

> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. I may take up to a minute to respond as I await the deployment.
